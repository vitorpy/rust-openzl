The OpenZL Python extension is in the module `openzl.ext`.
It is a direct wrapper of the OpenZL C++ API.
The top level `openzl.` namespace is being reserved for a more Pythonic layer built on top of the binding.

See the [Python quick start example](../../getting-started/examples/py/quick-start.md) to get started.
